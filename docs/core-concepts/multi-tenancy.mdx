title: Multi-Tenancy
description: "Ryumem supports multiple levels of isolation for secure data management."
---

Ryumem is designed as a multi-tenant system from the ground up, supporting secure isolation between customers and users.

## Isolation Levels

1.  **Customer Level**: Strict isolation. Data from one customer is never accessible to another. Enforced via API keys.
2.  **User Level**: Logical separation within a customer. Use `user_id` to scope memories to specific end-users.
3.  **Session/Agent Level**: Further scoping via `session_id` or `agent_id` for specific interaction contexts.

## Usage

```python
ryumem.add_episode(
    content="...",
    group_id="organization_1",      # Organization level
    user_id="user_123",             # User level
    agent_id="agent_assistant",     # Agent level
    session_id="session_xyz",       # Session level
)

# Search within specific scope
results = ryumem.search(
    query="...",
    group_id="organization_1",
    user_id="user_123",             # Optional: filter by user
)
```
