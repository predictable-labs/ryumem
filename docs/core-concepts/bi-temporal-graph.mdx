title: Bi-Temporal Graph
description: "Ryumem tracks two timelines for each fact."
---

Ryumem uses a bi-temporal data model to track when facts were valid and when they were recorded.

## Timelines

1.  **valid_at**: When the fact was true in the real world.
2.  **invalid_at**: When the fact stopped being true.
3.  **expired_at**: When the fact was superseded/invalidated in the system.

This allows Ryumem to handle contradictions and updates gracefully, ensuring that the knowledge graph always reflects the most current understanding while retaining historical context.
