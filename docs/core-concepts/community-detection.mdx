title: Community Detection
description: "Automatically cluster related entities into communities."
---

Ryumem uses the Louvain algorithm to cluster related entities into communities. Each community gets an LLM-generated summary describing the common theme and relationships.

## Usage

```python
# Detect communities periodically
num_communities = ryumem.update_communities("user_123")
print(f"Created {num_communities} communities")

# Fine-tune clustering
num_communities = ryumem.update_communities(
    "user_123",
    resolution=1.5,  # Higher = more fine-grained communities
    min_community_size=3,  # Minimum entities per community
)
```
