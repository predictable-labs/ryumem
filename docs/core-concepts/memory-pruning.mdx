Ryumem allows you to prune old or redundant data to maintain performance and reduce token usage.

## Features

-   Remove facts expired > N days ago.
-   Delete low-value entities (< 2 mentions, > 30 days old).
-   Merge near-duplicate facts (95%+ similarity).

## Usage

```python
# Prune old/redundant data periodically
stats = ryumem.prune_memories("user_123")
print(f"Pruning results: {stats}")
# Output: {'expired_edges_deleted': 15, 'entities_deleted': 3, 'edges_merged': 8}

# Customize pruning aggressiveness
stats = ryumem.prune_memories(
    "user_123",
    expired_cutoff_days=60,  # Delete facts expired > 60 days ago
    min_mentions=3,  # Keep only entities with 3+ mentions
    compact_redundant=True,  # Merge near-duplicate facts
)
```
