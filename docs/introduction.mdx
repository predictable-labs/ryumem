## Why Ryumem?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="bolt" title="One-Line Setup">
    Add memory to Google ADK agents with a single function call. No configuration, no boilerplate - just instant memory.

    ```python
    memory = add_memory_to_agent(agent, ryumem_instance=ryumem)
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="wand-magic-sparkles" title="Automatic Tool Tracking">
    Every tool execution is automatically logged with parameters, results, and timestamps. Perfect for debugging and analytics.

    ```python
    memory = add_memory_to_agent(agent, ryumem_instance=ryumem, enable_tool_tracking=True)
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="sparkles" title="Query Augmentation">
    New queries are automatically enriched with context from similar past conversations, helping agents learn and improve over time.

    ```python
    runner = wrap_runner_with_tracking(runner, memory, augment_queries=True)
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="brain" title="Knowledge Graph Memory">
    Unlike flat memory systems, Ryumem builds a knowledge graph with entities and relationships, enabling intelligent retrieval and reasoning.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Temporal Awareness">
    Tracks when facts were valid (valid_at) and when they were recorded (created_at), automatically handling contradictions and outdated information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="magnifying-glass" title="Hybrid Search">
    Combines semantic search (embeddings), keyword search (BM25), and graph traversal for the most relevant results.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="users" title="Built-in Multi-Tenancy">
    Isolate memories by user, session, agent, or any custom grouping - perfect for production applications.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="gauge-high" title="Production Ready">
    Hosted service handles scaling, embeddings, and LLM inference - you just focus on building your agent.
  </Accordion>
