This guide demonstrates the fundamental operations in Ryumem: initialization, adding episodes, and performing searches.

## Initialize Ryumem

First, import and initialize Ryumem with your server URL and API key:

```python
from ryumem import Ryumem

# Initialize with your self-hosted Ryumem server
ryumem = Ryumem(
    api_url="http://localhost:8000",
    api_key="ryu_your_api_key_here",
)
```

<Note>
Need to set up Ryumem? See the [Setup Guide](/setup) for Docker Compose or local installation instructions.
</Note>

## Add Episodes

Episodes are the fundamental unit of memory in Ryumem. Each episode contains content that gets parsed into entities and relationships:

```python
# Add your first episode
ryumem.add_episode(
    content="Alice works at Google in Mountain View as a Software Engineer.",
    group_id="user_123",
)

# Add a related episode
ryumem.add_episode(
    content="Bob is Alice's colleague and recently moved to Meta.",
    group_id="user_123",
)
```

<Tip>
The `group_id` parameter is used for multi-tenancy. Use it to isolate memories by user, session, or any other grouping.
</Tip>

## Search Memories

Ryumem supports multiple search strategies. The hybrid strategy combines semantic search, keyword search (BM25), and graph traversal:

```python
# Search using hybrid strategy
results = ryumem.search(
    query="Where does Alice work?",
    group_id="user_123",
    strategy="hybrid",  # Combines semantic + BM25 + graph traversal
    limit=10,
)

# Display entities found
for entity in results.entities:
    score = results.scores.get(entity.uuid, 0.0)
    print(f"{entity.name} ({entity.entity_type}) - Score: {score:.3f}")

# Display relationships (edges) found
for edge in results.edges:
    print(f"Relationship: {edge.fact}")
```

### Search Strategies

- **`semantic`** - Uses embeddings for meaning-based search
- **`bm25`** - Traditional keyword-based search
- **`graph_traversal`** - Explores connected entities
- **`hybrid`** - Combines all three methods (recommended)

Learn more in [Search Strategies](/core-concepts/search-strategies).

## Get Entity Context

Retrieve comprehensive information about a specific entity:

```python
# Get all context for an entity
context = ryumem.get_entity_context(
    entity_name="Alice",
    group_id="user_123",
)

print(f"Entity: {context['entity']['name']}")
print(f"Type: {context['entity']['entity_type']}")
print(f"Relationships: {context['relationship_count']}")
```

## Complete Example

Here's a complete working example:

```python
from ryumem import Ryumem

# Initialize with your self-hosted server
ryumem = Ryumem(
    api_url="http://localhost:8000",
    api_key="ryu_your_api_key_here"
)

# Add knowledge
ryumem.add_episode(
    content="Alice works at Google in Mountain View as a Software Engineer.",
    group_id="user_123",
)

ryumem.add_episode(
    content="Bob is Alice's colleague and recently moved to Meta.",
    group_id="user_123",
)

# Search
results = ryumem.search(
    query="Where does Alice work?",
    group_id="user_123",
    strategy="hybrid",
    limit=10,
)

# Process results
for entity in results.entities:
    score = results.scores.get(entity.uuid, 0.0)
    print(f"{entity.name} - {score:.3f}")
```
