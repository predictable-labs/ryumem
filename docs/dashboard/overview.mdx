The Ryumem dashboard provides a modern web interface for visualizing and managing your knowledge graph memory system.

<Note>
**Access Required**: You need a Ryumem API key to access the dashboard. Contact **contact@predictable.sh** to get access.
</Note>

## Accessing the Dashboard

The dashboard is available as a hosted service. Once you have your API key:

1. Navigate to the dashboard URL (provided with your API key)
2. Enter your API key (starts with `ryu_`)
3. Click "Sign in"

Your API key is stored securely in your browser and used for all API requests.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard provides **7 main tabs** for different operations (5 tabs when entity extraction is disabled):

## Tab Reference

### Chat & Query

**What it does:** Natural language interface for searching your knowledge graph.

**Key Features:**
- Enter queries in natural language (e.g., "Where does Alice work?")
- Select search strategy: Hybrid (recommended), Semantic, BM25, or Traversal
- View results as entity cards with scores
- See relationships and facts with metadata
- Example queries for quick testing

**Common Workflows:**
- Search for specific information: Use natural language queries
- Find related entities: Use Hybrid strategy for best results
- Exact keyword matching: Use BM25 strategy
- Explore relationships: Use Traversal strategy

### Graph Visualization

<Note>
Requires entity extraction to be enabled
</Note>

**What it shows:** Interactive force-directed visualization of your knowledge graph.

**Key Features:**
- Entity nodes colored by type (Person, Organization, Place, etc.)
- Relationship edges with labeled connections
- Zoom and pan controls
- Filter by entity type
- Click entities for detailed information

**When to use:**
- Understand entity relationships visually
- Explore community clusters
- Identify connection patterns
- Present knowledge graph structure

### Entities

<Note>
Requires entity extraction to be enabled
</Note>

**What it displays:** Searchable list of all entities in your knowledge graph.

**Key Features:**
- Paginated entity list (50 items per page)
- Filter by entity type
- Sort by mentions or creation date
- Entity detail panel with relationships
- Connected entities navigation
- Source episodes tracking

**Exploration Workflows:**
- Browse all entities: Use pagination
- Find specific entity types: Apply filters
- Explore relationships: Click entity for details
- Trace information sources: View source episodes

### Episodes

**What you can do:** View and add memories to your knowledge graph.

**Key Features:**
- View all episodes with pagination
- Filter by user_id, agent_id, or session_id
- Add new episodes via form
- See episode metadata (source, timestamps)
- Link to tool analytics

**Adding Episodes:**
1. Click "Add Episode" button
2. Enter content (text, message, or JSON format)
3. Select source type
4. Add optional metadata (user_id, agent_id, session_id)
5. Submit - entities are extracted automatically

**Filtering Options:**
- By user: View memories for specific users
- By agent: See what specific agents learned
- By session: Track conversation threads

### Query History

**What it tracks:** Historical queries made to the system with augmentation details.

**Key Features:**
- View all queries with timestamps
- See query augmentation with historical context
- Track similar query patterns
- Analyze search effectiveness

**Use Cases:**
- Understand query patterns
- See how augmentation improves responses
- Debug search behavior
- Identify common information needs

### Tool Analytics

**What metrics are shown:** Execution statistics and performance for tracked tools.

**Key Features:**
- Tool execution counts
- Performance metrics (timing, success rates)
- Parameter and result tracking
- Filter by tool name
- Link from episodes

**How to Analyze:**
- Identify frequently used tools
- Track tool performance over time

## Tips & Best Practices

<Tip>
**Search Strategy Selection**: Use Hybrid for most queries. Switch to BM25 for exact keyword matching or Traversal for relationship-focused searches.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Entity Extraction Cost Optimization**: Disable entity extraction in Settings to save 30-50% on LLM token costs if you don't need graph visualization.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Multi-Tenancy**: Always filter by user_id, agent_id, or session_id in production to isolate data properly.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Query Augmentation**: Enable in Settings to let agents learn from past similar queries and improve over time.
</Tip>
