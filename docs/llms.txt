# Ryumem

> Semantic memory layer for AI agents - open source, self-hosted

Ryumem is an open-source semantic memory system that enables AI agents to store, search, and retrieve episodic memories with automatic knowledge graph extraction.

## Key Features

- Episodic memory storage with automatic entity/relationship extraction
- Hybrid search combining semantic, BM25, and graph traversal
- Multi-tenant isolation for user/session separation
- MCP server integration for Claude and other AI assistants
- Google ADK integration for Gemini-based agents
