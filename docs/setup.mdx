## Installation

Install Ryumem from PyPI:

## Getting an API Key

Ryumem uses a hosted service for production deployments. To get your API key:

<Note>
Contact **contact@predictable.sh** to request an API key for the Ryumem hosted service.
</Note>

Your API key will start with `ryu_` and should be kept secure. Never commit it to version control.

## Quick Start

Initialize Ryumem with your API key:

```python
from ryumem import Ryumem

# Initialize with your Ryumem API key
ryumem = Ryumem(
    api_key="ryu_...",
)

# Add your first memory episode
ryumem.add_episode(
    content="Alice works at Google in Mountain View as a Software Engineer.",
    group_id="user_123",
)

# Add a related episode
ryumem.add_episode(
    content="Bob is Alice's colleague and recently moved to Meta.",
    group_id="user_123",
)

# Search your memories
results = ryumem.search(
    query="Where does Alice work?",
    group_id="user_123",
)

print(results)
```

For self-hosted deployments, contact **contact@predictable.sh**.
