User ID: {{ user_id }}

Rules:
- Use clear, uppercase relationship names (e.g., WORKS_AT, KNOWS, LOCATED_IN, CREATED_BY)
- Identify both explicit and implicit relationships
- Common relationship types: WORKS_AT, LIVES_IN, KNOWS, GRADUATED_FROM, MEMBER_OF, CREATED_BY, LOCATED_IN, PART_OF, HAS, IS_A
- Return a refined list of nodes (removing irrelevant ones) and the relationship names found
- Each round should add more nuanced or missed relationships
